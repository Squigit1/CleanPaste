# CleanPaste

CleanPaste is a small Python tool that automatically **removes hidden formatting** (zero-width spaces, non-breaking spaces, etc.) from text you copy into your clipboard.  
It helps when pasting between apps (e.g., from a browser into Word, or from Docs into code) where weird formatting usually sneaks in.
